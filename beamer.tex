  \frametitle{Personal Information}
  \framesubtitle{Education}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item obtained my \emph{Bachelor}'s degree in \emph{Electronic Information
            Engineering} from \href{https://njust.edu.cn}{\emph{Nanjing
              University of Science and Technology}}
    \item currently a \emph{second-year graduate student} majoring in
          \emph{Information and Communication Engineering}
    \item applying for the \emph{doctor} program in
          \emph{Electronic Information Engineering}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Experience}
  \framesubtitle{undergraduate}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item It was during my second year in college that I developed a strong
          interest in \emph{embedded development}, which led me to spend my spare
          time learning related knowledge and participating in competitions, winning
          numerous awards
    \item In my third year, I started learning how to use Vim for development
          under Linux, and now I am a \emph{skilled Linux user and Vim plugin
            developer}
    \item During my senior year, I started learning about \emph{deep learning}
          and chose it as my graduation project
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Experience}
  \framesubtitle{now}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item particularly interested in \emph{deploying models and algorithms on
            edge devices}
    \item In my graduate studies, I have been responsible for the core task of
          deploying \emph{traditional audio and video encoding algorithms to DSPs}
          and \emph{deep learning-based image compression algorithms to FPGAs}
    \item During this period, I learned how to \emph{write high-quality code}
          by using build systems, unit testing, and CI/CD
    \item have a strong interest in the \emph{security of deep learning-based
            image and video encoding algorithms and neural networks}, and I
          chose this as my research field for my master's thesis

  \frametitle{Motivation}
  \framesubtitle{Why I want to apply for the doctor program}
  \begin{block}{Question}
    What is the fundamental difference between a master's degree and a doctor?
  \end{block}
  \pause%
  \begin{block}{My Answer}
    the ability about \alert{knowledge}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Motivation}
  \framesubtitle{What is the ability about \alert{knowledge}}
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \item A \emph{bachelor}'s degree student can \alert{learn knowledge under
            the guidance of a teacher}
    \item A \emph{master}'s degree student must have the ability to \alert{learn
            knowledge independently}
    \item The ability to \alert{create knowledge independently} is the standard
          for evaluating whether a person meets the requirements of a \emph{doctor}
  \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Motivation}
  \framesubtitle{So why I want to apply for the doctor program}
  \begin{block}{Question}
    Why I want to apply for the doctor program?
  \end{block}
  \pause%
  \begin{block}{My Answer}
    gain the ability to \alert{create knowledge independently} by pursuing a
    doctor
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Working Project}
  \framesubtitle{after being admitted to the doctor program}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item continue my research in the field of \emph{deep learning-based image
            and video encoding algorithms}
    \item publish two \emph{A}-class papers to meet the graduation requirements
    \item prove my ability to \alert{create knowledge independently}
  \end{enumerate}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Acknowledge}
  Thank you for your attention!

  You can ask me any question.
